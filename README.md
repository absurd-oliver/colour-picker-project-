# builder.js standalone builder  
## ensure that the following requirements are met:  
  
• node.js installed  
• nodemon installed    
• have your own .json files to execute the build functionalities  

## Attention !  
Add a DOMContentLoaded wrapper around all your inline DOM code.  
Keep top-level async functions outside the wrapper so they stay accessible
